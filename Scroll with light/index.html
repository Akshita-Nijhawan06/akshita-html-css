    <div class="content">
      <p>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
        How I wonder what you are!
        Up above the world so high,
        Like a diamond in the sky.</p>
        <p>
            When the blazing sun is gone,
            When he nothing shines upon,
            Then you show your little light,
            Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.
        </p>

      <p>
        Then the trav'ller in the dark,
        Thanks you for your tiny spark,
        He could not see which way to go,
        If you did not twinkle so.
      </p>
      <p>
            In the dark blue sky you keep,
            And often thro' my curtains peep,
            For you never shut your eye,
            Till the sun is in the sky.
      </p>  
      <p>
        'Tis your bright and tiny spark,
        Lights the trav'ller in the dark:
        Tho' I know not what you are,
        Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
